This is a test document with some mathematics, like $x = 5y$, and

$$
\int^x_0 y\; dy,
$$

as well as some code blocks, such as [^1]

```rs
pub fn main() {
    println!("Hello world!");
}
```

There exists a bunch more things, for example, another [^2]

[^1]: Hi! This is a footnote!
[^2]: Footnote

# This is some heading

Just a bunch of things to test it out

## This shouldn't add numbers

alsdgklafh;

# But this should!

more stuff
